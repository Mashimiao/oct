The `octest` will be a `rolling release` tool which keeps updating with OCI specs.
[How to Try](octest/README.md)

The `specValidator` verifies all the specs configurations, so it is a much bigger project
and we will only validate the `stable` spec release.
So far the tool is compliance with `45ae53d4dba8e550942f7384914206103f6d2216` commit.
Please following this [instruction](specValidator/README.md).
